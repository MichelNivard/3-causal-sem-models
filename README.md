# 3-causal-sem-models

This repo describes three structural equation models (SEM) in which, based on cross sectional data, **(cyclical) networks** and **latent variable** models are identified. Because the models can, if assumptions are met, deal with endogeneity (i.e. the fact that frequntly most or  all variables in psychological models are potentially exposure and outcome and cannot easily be experimentally issolated) they are especially **well suited for causal inference in psychological sciences.**

You should probably be falmiliar witht he following techniques/concepts if you want to feel competent and confident applying these models to emperical data, but do not let that hold you back from browsing this repo and trying the interactive notebooks.

- structural equation modeling, or SEM (here is a youtube course, here an online book to refresh or learn)
- instrumental variable analysis (here is a tutorial, here is a longer piece).
- shrinkage estimatators/penalties (applied in SEM)
