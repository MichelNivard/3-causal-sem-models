## multi comoment SEM (MCMSEM)

In previous work we have linked causal inference based on higher order moments (which itself is based on a long reseach tradition, for references see below) and a causal SEM model. In the current pre-print we introduce a straightforward mutlivariate extension.


- [Here is an interactive notebook](https://github.com/MichelNivard/3-causal-sem-models/blob/main/Multi_comoment_structural_equation_model_(MCMSEM).ipynb) you can run chunk by chunk in google colab
- In this folder you find scripts we used in our paper for monte-carlo simulation, you can adapt these to figure otu whether at your sample size and with     your group structure to evaluate whether the model suits you.

In psychological sciences measurement based on scales means that the moments of the measured data quite possibly refects scale as much as it relfects the moments of the underlying constructs. We sugest where necessary first applying an (IRT) measurement model that retain the moments of the undferlying trait could offer a solution.
