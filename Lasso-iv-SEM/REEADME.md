# LASSO IV SEM

Lasso IV SEM is a merger of 3 things: It is instrumental variable analysis (1) where a Lasso penalty is sued to find instruments (2) implemented as a structural equatino model (SEM)(3).

All three pairwise ingredients use in this techniqueexisted before. 

This is a paper on using LAsso shrinkage to finding instruments: Windmeijer, F., Farbmacher, H., Davies, N., & Davey Smith, G. (2019). On the use of the lasso for instrumental variables estimation with some invalid instruments. Journal of the American Statistical Association, 114(527), 1339-1350.

This is a tutorial where insturmentla variable analysis is implemented as a SEM model: https://rpsychologist.com/adherence-analysis-IV-brms
