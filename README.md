# 3-causal-sem-models

This repo describes three structural equation models (SEM) in which, based on cross sectional data, **(cyclical) networks** and **latent variable** models are identified. Because the models can, if assumptions are met, deal with endogeneity (i.e. the fact that frequntly most or  all variables in psychological models are potentially exposure and outcome and cannot easily be experimentally issolated) they are especially **well suited for causal inference in psychological sciences.**
